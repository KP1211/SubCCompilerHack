Things I noticed about this subset of C that SubC compiles.
        
-The subset of C is a (mostly) strict and sane subset of
    C as described in "The C Programming Language", 2nd Ed (also
    known informally as "ANSI C" or "C89").

-Cannot Declare and Initialize in the same line.

-Must Declare all variable up top, and then Initialize after all have been Declare, 
    otherwise will cause "syntax error at: *type*"
    For Example: 
        int a;
        a = 4;
        int b;
        b = 6;
    Will NOT compile... But
        int a;
        int b;
        a = 4;
        b = 6;
    Will compile.   

-When using printf() to print integer, use %d, SubC Compiler doesn't recognize %i.

Need to find how they input the c file into the pgoram and how they are store.
This will provide me a way to hardcode helloworld.c into the program to be compared.

Fix bug where fgets() would read in some extra chars on the last line.
    Example:
        return 0;
        }
    What's read:
        return 0;
        }return0;
    It's weird...
    FIXEDDDDD, turns out I modified the helloworld.c file and it fucked it up, without me knowing.

Need to find how to search for a sub-string in a stream. Find substring pointed by FILE object.

Need to find how to modify a a input stream.
    How to replace char on stream. replace char pointed by FILE object.
    How to insert strings into stream. insert strings pointed by FILE object.


Take a look at next();
    Make a global array of the source code I wanna compile, a one liner. Then feed it through next().

Need to find how they input the c file into the pgoram and how they are store.
This will provide me a way to hardcode helloworld.c into the program to be compared.

Fix bug where fgets() would read in some extra chars on the last line.
    Example:
        return 0;
        }
    What's read:
        return 0;
        }return0;
    It's weird...
    FIXEDDDDD, turns out I modified the helloworld.c file and it fucked it up, without me knowing.

Found the function to modify anything in double quotes that counts as a string in the compiling process.

Find the function to covert a block of function code to binary.

Find out how #include behave
